# Vsmaf

**Vsmaf** is a vector-space-based framework designed for matching algorithms. Here's a range of features it mainly supports:

* **Dimensionality Reduction** : Supports techniques to reduce the dimensions of high-dimensional data to make it more manageable and interpretable.
* **2D/3D Visualization** : Provides tools for visualizing multidimensional vector spaces in two or three dimensions, aiding in the understanding of the data's structure.
* **Sorting, Filtering, and Clustering** : Allows for operations such as sorting, filtering, and clustering of points within a multidimensional vector space.

## Purpose and Use Case

Vsmaf is designed to facilitate the manipulation and analysis of high-dimensional data through vector space models. It is particularly useful for:

* Researchers and data scientists who need to apply dimensionality reduction techniques.
* Developers working on matching algorithms that require robust sorting, filtering, and clustering capabilities.
* Any project involving the visualization of complex, multidimensional datasets to better understand their structure and relationships.
